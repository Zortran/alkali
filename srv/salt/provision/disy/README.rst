disy
====
disy - prounounced dicey, creates symlinks and directories
that reside on all systems by default.  Also allows for
management of directories and symlinks that target hosts
with a matching "function_class" grain.  For example,
for all systems hosting mysql/mariadb/percona databases,
a function_class that groups these might be mariadb.

Customize the disy.sls pillar file as necessary.
